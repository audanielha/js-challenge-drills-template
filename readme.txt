Challenge: Simple Shopping Cart

Objective: Create a basic shopping cart program using JavaScript variables and arrays.

Instructions:
Create an array named shoppingCart to store items that will be added to the cart.

Write a function addItem that takes an item name as an argument and adds it to the shoppingCart array.

Write a function removeItem that takes an item name and removes it from the shoppingCart array if it exists.

Write a function listItems that logs each item currently in the shoppingCart array to the console.

Output:

Use the addItem, removeItem, and listItems functions to demonstrate adding items to the cart, removing an item, and listing all items.

For example, "Added 'Apple' to the cart", "Removed 'Banana' from the cart", "Current items in the cart: Apple, Orange".

Bonus:

Implement a function totalItems that returns the total number of items in the cart and logs it to the console.

Enhance the shoppingCart array to store items as objects with properties like name and price, and modify the functions to handle the new structure.
